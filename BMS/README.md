Problem statement 

You would have booked tickets from Bookmyshow for a movie. We want you to build an inventory management system with the APIs. APIs should be able to do the following things: 

1. Asked about a movie should be able to tell which cinema and timing of the movie. 
2. Should be able to add a movie with some timing to a given cinema. 
3. Should be able to tell the empty/Booked seats of a cinema. 
4. Save the different layout of the cinemas. 
5. Should be able to reserve the tickets for sometime till the payment is made and then free it. 

Expectation 
1. Design of the APIs  (Please make sure they are extendable)
2. Schema design.
3. Running code. 
4. Code should be well designed 

Bonus
1. Code with modularity in mind. 
2. Code with Test. 
3. Design can take care of IPL matches too. 

Language to use
1. Java / Python
2. Sql

UI is not needed in the project. We can use Postman to use the apis. Please take 5-7 days to complete its fine but please make sure itâ€™s your best attempt.
